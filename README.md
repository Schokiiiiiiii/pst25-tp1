## Description

This repository is to complete the first practical work of the "Probability and Statistics" course from the HEIG-VD
in Yverdon-Les-Bains.

The goal is to learn about R, RStudio, Positron, Quatro and much more.

Different exercises are given and need to be solved.

The end task takes form as a report containing the solutions to all exercises. The report must be written using Quatro.
Because the school teaches in French, the report will also be in French. This readme only serves as a way to explain
to outside explorers ending up on this repository.
